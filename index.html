                    life beyond "learn to code"
                </p>
                <p>
                    The year <b>2021</b> needs no introduction&mdash;things are
                    rapidly changing and we are told a "new normal" is inevitable.
                    Here at <b>postnerd</b> we are motivated to not passively wait
                    as the future "happens" to us. Specifically, we are working on
                    solutions to offer <em>alternatives</em> to things like:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>automation</b> when unneeded&mdash;e.g. phone robots when people do better</li>
                    <li><b>artificial intelligence</b>&mdash;the complex fabric of life is not a mechanical chessboard!</li>
                    <li><b>overseas outsourcing</b>&mdash;when possible, we should try to work with those around us rather than cutting costs and destroying communities</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    While big tech and large corporate solutions can offer
                    deliver slick, "one size fits all" kinds of projects, this
                    is often done in the manner of the <b>Bed of Procrustes</b>&mdash;adjusting
                    the customer to the shape of the project, rather than
                    the other way around!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We aim to do just the opposite&mdash;bringing <em>people</em>
                    back to the front and leverage existing tech products to
                    design robust, easily maintainable systems that make nerds
                    elsewhere manage the small, costly details and research and
                    development of platforms we <em>don't</em> control.
                </p>

                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>
                    We created <b>postnerd</b> to
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are not "anti-technology". As can be seen below, we make
                    use of social media, sites like those in the links below.
                    To the contrary, we strive to <em>extract maximum value</em> from
                    those services freely offered to us. We aren't zealots for
                    anonymity or privacy&mdash;ID verification has its place in
                    society. On the other hand, we don't believe you should ask
                    for and retain information longer than is needed to conduct
                    honest business.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We look forward to getting in touch with you!
