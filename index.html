                    The year <b>2021</b> needs no introduction&mdash;things are
                    rapidly changing and we are told a "new normal" is inevitable.
                    Here at Postnerd we are motivated to not passively wait
                    as the future "happens" to us. Specifically, we are working on
                    solutions to offer <em>alternatives</em> to things like:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>automation</b> when unneeded&mdash;e.g. phone robots when people do better</li>
                    <li><b>artificial intelligence</b>&mdash;the complex fabric of life is not a mechanical chessboard!</li>
                    <li><b>overseas outsourcing</b>&mdash;when possible, we should try to work with those around us rather than cutting costs and destroying communities</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    While big tech and large corporate solutions can offer
                    deliver slick, "one size fits all" kinds of projects, this
                    is often done in the manner of the <b>Bed of Procrustes</b>&mdash;adjusting
                    the customer to the shape of the project, rather than
                    the other way around!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We aim to do just the opposite&mdash;bringing <em>people</em>
                    back to the front and leverage existing tech products to
                    design robust, easily maintainable systems that make nerds
                    elsewhere manage the small, costly details and research and
                    development of platforms we <em>don't</em> control.
                </p>

                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>
                    Postnerd is a "lean startup" aiming at providing low cost, low
                    maintenance technology solutions to people who share similar
                    concerns with us about the societal effects of the
                    spread of digital technologies. We seek to empower our customers
                    by showing them how they can use technologies to work for them
                    <em>without</em> expensive contracts, privacy invasive marketing
                    schemes, or over-paying nerds to try to describe people with
                    numbers in databases.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our name "postnerd" means "after (being a) nerd"&mdash;by
                    training, many tech professionals are taught to be highly
                    specialized, interchangeable parts. Our philosophy is the
                    opposite&mdash;we recognize the uniqueness of each individual
                    and how <b>custom solutions</b> using <b>common and easy to use tools</b> are often
                    the most cost-effective solutions for actually getting things
                    done.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We created postnerd to <em>do something</em> about
                    some disturbing trends that really got going in the twenty-first
                    century. Specifically, the arrival of the smartphone has ushered
                    in an un-precedented era of centralized control and surveillance
                    with the decisions of very small, un-elected groups of people
                    exercising massive influence (and thus control through subtle
                    suggestion) of millions of people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are not "anti-technology". As can be seen below, we make
                    use of social media, sites like those in the links below.
                    To the contrary, we strive to <em>extract maximum value</em> from
                    those services freely offered to us. We aren't zealots for
                    anonymity or privacy&mdash;ID verification has its place in
                    society. On the other hand, we don't believe you should ask
                    for and retain information longer than is needed to conduct
                    honest business.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We look forward to getting in touch with you!
                </p>
